A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model thatâ€™s used for classification task. 
The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem.


Assumptions: 
1) Predictors are independant of each other.
2) Naive Bayes is a generative model.
3) Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that each class follow a Gaussian distribution.
